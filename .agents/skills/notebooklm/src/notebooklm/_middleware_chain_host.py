"""Middleware-chain host.

The :class:`MiddlewareChainHost` owns the four pieces of state that the
wired middleware chain reads on every authed POST plus the chain leaf
itself:

* the three retry-budget tunables (``_rate_limit_max_retries`` /
  ``_server_error_max_retries`` / ``_refresh_retry_delay``) that the
  chain's provider lambdas dereference live (``getattr(host, …)``);
* the installed chain reference (``_authed_post_chain``) that the
  transport's ``chain_provider`` closure dereferences on every authed
  POST so post-construction reassignment continues to steer the live
  chain;
* the chain leaf coroutine (``_authed_post_chain_terminal``) that
  forwards to :meth:`SessionTransport.terminal`;
* the dynamic refresh delegate (``await_refresh``) reached by the
  middleware chain (``wire_middleware_chain`` captures
  ``chain_host.await_refresh`` directly).

This module is intentionally narrow:

* It does NOT know about metrics, the kernel, the http client, the
  RPC semaphore, or the auth snapshot. Those live on :class:`Session`
  (the auth-snapshot host) and the collaborator bundle.
* The host has no back-reference to :class:`Session` — it is reachable
  from :class:`Session` (via ``self._chain_host``) but not the other
  way around. This breaks the historical Session ↔ transport cycle the
  way ADR-014 Rule 4 anticipated.

The transport / wire helpers take the host directly via the
``chain_host`` parameter; the chain reads ``chain_host._<attr>`` on
every attempt. Tests that need a mid-flight mutation rebind on the
host (``core._chain_host._<attr> = ...``); there are no Session-side
forwards in front of the host.

    """Owner of the middleware-chain mutable state and chain leaf.

    Constructed by :func:`compose_client_internals` BEFORE
    :class:`Session`. The transport is bound write-once via
    :meth:`_bind_transport` after :func:`build_session_transport`
    returns — this resolves the host ↔ transport construction cycle
    without giving either side a permanent back-reference to the other.

    Attributes:
        _auth_refresh: The :class:`AuthRefreshCoordinator` collaborator.
            :meth:`await_refresh` looks up the coordinator dynamically
            on every call so a fixture-time rebind of
            ``host._auth_refresh.await_refresh = fake`` keeps steering
            the live refresh-and-retry path.
        _rate_limit_max_retries: Budget consumed by the retry middleware
            on 429 responses. Stored on the host (the chain's provider
            lambda reads this attribute live, so mid-flight rebinding
            takes effect on the next attempt).
        _server_error_max_retries: Budget consumed by the retry
            middleware on 5xx responses. Same live-read contract.
        _refresh_retry_delay: Backoff between refresh-retry attempts
            in the auth-refresh middleware. Same live-read contract.
        _authed_post_chain: The wired middleware chain. ``None`` until
            :func:`compose_client_internals` assigns it directly here.
            The transport's ``chain_provider`` lambda reads this
            attribute every authed POST.
        _transport: The :class:`SessionTransport` collaborator. ``None``
            until :meth:`_bind_transport` fires; after that bind the
            chain leaf (:meth:`_authed_post_chain_terminal`) can forward
            to ``transport.terminal``.
