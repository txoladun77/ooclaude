    """Resolve a partial artifact ID to a full ID.

    UUID-shaped IDs (canonical 8-4-4-4-12 hex layout, case-insensitive -
    see :data:`notebooklm.cli.resolve.FULL_ID_PATTERN`) are validated against
    the pre-fetched ``artifacts`` list (full-ID passthrough is disabled for
    this path via ``allow_full_id_passthrough=False``). A UUID not present
    in ``artifacts`` raises the canonical local "not found" error instead
    of passing through to a backend 404. Anything else - including a 25-char
    prefix of a 36-char UUID - is matched as a case-insensitive prefix
    against the artifact list, so unique prefixes resolve locally rather
    than reaching the backend as truncated IDs.

    The matching logic is delegated to
    :func:`notebooklm.cli.resolve.resolve_partial_id_in_items` (the canonical
    sync core shared with the async resolver), supplied with the dict-shaped
    accessor pair (the download path stores artifacts as
    :class:`ArtifactDict`, not the dataclass shape the async resolver
    consumes) and the ``ValueError`` factory (the download command body
    catches ``ValueError`` and converts to an error envelope, so we keep
    the historical exception type rather than ``click.ClickException``).

    The "no match" / "ambiguous" message text retains its historical wording
    rather than the canonical resolver's wording - the download command's
    user-visible error envelope text predates P2.T1 consolidation and a
    customer or external test could rely on it. The translation costs about
    8 lines and keeps the user contract verbatim. Successful partial matches
    also remain silent, matching the historical download helper behavior.

    Args:
        artifacts: Pre-fetched list of artifacts to search.
        artifact_id: Full or partial artifact ID.

    Returns:
        Full artifact ID.
