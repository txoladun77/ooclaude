"""Playwright-driven Google login service (ADR-008 click-to-service extraction).

Owns the entire Playwright fast path for ``notebooklm login`` (the rookiepy
``--browser-cookies`` path stays in :mod:`notebooklm.cli.services.login`).
Extracted from :mod:`notebooklm.cli.session_cmd` in P3.T3 so the Click
handler can stay a thin orchestrator.

Public entry points
===================

* :class:`PlaywrightLoginPlan` — frozen dataclass describing one Playwright
  login attempt (browser channel, target paths, optional cookie-domain
  inclusion).
* :func:`run_playwright_login` — synchronous executor: opens the browser,
  drives the SSO flow, persists ``storage_state.json`` atomically.
* :func:`prepare_login_paths` — resolves storage + browser profile paths
  for a ``login`` invocation (including the ``--fresh`` profile wipe).
* :func:`validate_login_flag_conflicts` — flag mutual-exclusion gate.
* :func:`filter_storage_state_cookies_by_domain_policy` — applies the
  P1-17 cookie-domain allowlist to a Playwright ``storage_state`` dict.

The handler keeps the legacy ``_run_playwright_login`` / ``_prepare_login_paths``
patch surfaces (re-exported via ``session_cmd.py``) so existing tests
that ``patch("notebooklm.cli.session_cmd._run_playwright_login")`` keep
working byte-for-byte.

# When we surface captured stderr / stdout from a Playwright subprocess to
# the user (e.g. the install failure path below), the raw text can carry
# two classes of noise we never want to leak into the console:
#
#   1. Environment-variable VALUES — Playwright forwards the parent process
#      environment; if any secret (PSIDTS, API tokens, cookie material set
#      via the auth-source env var / SAPISID / etc.) is interpolated into
#      a traceback / config line by the CLI we invoke, it lands verbatim
#      in ``result.stderr``.
#
#   2. ANSI control sequences — pip/playwright CLIs emit progress bars and
#      colour codes that mangle log scrapers and dirty test snapshots.
#
# ``redact_subprocess_output`` strips both before the diagnostic reaches the
# console. Env-var redaction is conservative: we skip empty / single-char
# values and common boolean-ish / path-separator constants that would
# false-positive across normal stderr lines.

# CSI: ESC '[' parameter-bytes intermediate-bytes final-byte
# OSC: ESC ']' ... (BEL | ESC '\\')
# Plus a catch-all for any remaining two-byte C1 Fe sequence (the
# 0x40-0x5F final-byte range). CSI and OSC are stripped first so this
# only fires on leftovers (PM ``ESC ^``, APC ``ESC _``, ST ``ESC \``,
