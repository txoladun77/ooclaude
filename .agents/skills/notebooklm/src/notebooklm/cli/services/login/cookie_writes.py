"""Cookie write + account-selection helpers.

Owns the path that persists extracted cookies to ``storage_state.json``
(``_write_extracted_cookies``) and the two account-selection helpers
(``_select_account`` for the ``--browser-cookies``-driven targeted
extraction, ``_select_refresh_account`` for the refresh-from-cached path).

Failure shape: every public helper here returns either its success value
OR a :class:`.outcomes.BrowserCookieOutcome` subclass on failure. Failure
paths no longer own exit policy; callers (the auth-inspect command, the
``login --browser-cookies`` refresh driver) dispatch on the outcome.
Nonfatal warnings still render through a tiny local emitter so text-mode
CLI behavior remains compatible.

Imports from :mod:`.outcomes`. The DAG (``test_login_package_dag.py``)
also allows edges to :mod:`.browser_accounts` and
:mod:`.cookie_domains` for future use, but neither is currently needed:
``_write_extracted_cookies`` and the selectors operate on already-loaded
cookie data + already-discovered accounts, and the selectors do not need
to query the cookie-domain policy themselves.
