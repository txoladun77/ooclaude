"""Shared cookie-jar enumeration helper.

Contains :func:`_enumerate_one_jar` — probes one rookiepy cookie set
against ``?authuser=N`` to return tagged :class:`Account` records. Both
the legacy single-jar path (``_read_browser_cookies``) and the Chromium
multi-profile fan-out path call this helper.

Also owns :data:`_ROOKIEPY_BROWSER_ALIASES` — the user-facing browser
name → rookiepy function-name map (referenced by
:mod:`.browser_accounts._read_browser_cookies` for the named-browser
dispatch path).

Failure shape: :func:`_enumerate_one_jar` returns either a list of
:class:`Account` records (success) OR a
:class:`.outcomes.BrowserCookieOutcome` subclass for cookie-policy /
stale-cookie failures. Network failures (``httpx.RequestError``) are
returned as :class:`.outcomes.NetworkFailure` in normal mode but
propagate unchanged in ``quiet=True`` fan-out mode — that caller must
distinguish transport failures from per-profile "signed out" so it can
abort cleanly. The boundary test
(``tests/unit/cli/test_services_boundary.py``) keeps this module in
:data:`GUARDED_PATHS`; there is no presentation or exit policy in this
file.

    """Probe ``?authuser=N`` against one cookie set and return tagged Accounts.

    Shared by both the legacy single-jar path and the chromium multi-profile
    fan-out path. ``browser_profile`` annotates the resulting Accounts so the
    fan-out caller can route writes back to the right source.

    Args:
        raw_cookies: rookiepy cookie dicts for one source.
        browser_name: The browser the cookies came from (for error messages).
        browser_profile: Tag attached to each Account (``"Default"``,
            ``"Profile 1"``, ...) or ``None`` for the legacy single-jar path.
        quiet: Suppress the loud multi-line user-facing message body in the
            returned outcome (the fan-out caller prints its own per-profile
            soft note for signed-out / stale-cookie profiles and would
            otherwise bleed those panels into the table output). The
            returned outcome class is unchanged; only the ``message``
            payload is collapsed when ``quiet=True``. Network errors
            (``httpx.RequestError``) are NOT downgraded — they propagate
            as-is so the caller can distinguish transport failures from
            per-profile "signed out".

    Returns:
        list[Account]: signed-in Google accounts on the success path.

        :class:`.outcomes.BrowserCookieOutcome`:
        * :class:`.outcomes.CookieValidationFailure` — missing required
          cookies / malformed policy.
        * :class:`.outcomes.StaleCookies` — Google rejected the cookie
          set (account chooser redirect, RotateCookies 401).
        * :class:`.outcomes.NetworkFailure` — account enumeration hit a
          transport error. In ``quiet=True`` mode this propagates as
          ``httpx.RequestError`` instead so Chromium fan-out aborts the
          whole discovery rather than treating every profile as signed out.

    Raises:
        httpx.RequestError: On network transport failure when ``quiet=True``.
            Re-raised unchanged so fan-out aborts (vs. silently downgrading
            every offline profile to a soft skip).
