"""Custom Click group with sectioned help output.

Organizes CLI commands into logical sections for better discoverability.

Section assignment is hardcoded in :class:`SectionedGroup` (see
``command_sections`` and ``command_groups``). When you add a new top-level
command, bin it explicitly — otherwise it lands in the "Other" safety-net
bin, which exists only for commands deliberately tagged
``category="misc"`` (set the attribute on the Click command after creation).

A unit test (`tests/unit/cli/test_grouped.py`) enforces this contract: any
unbinned, untagged top-level command will fail the suite, surfacing the
discoverability regression at PR review time.
