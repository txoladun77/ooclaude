"""MetricsMiddleware — per-RPC telemetry emitter for the Tier-12 chain.

Per ADR-009 §"Chain ordering" and master plan §2, ``MetricsMiddleware`` sits
just inside ``DrainMiddleware`` (and just outside ``SemaphoreMiddleware``) in
the final chain ordering
``[Drain, Metrics, Semaphore, Retry, AuthRefresh, ErrorInjection, Tracing]``.
PR 12.4 ships it as the OUTERMOST of two seeded middlewares
(``[Metrics, Tracing]``); PRs 12.5–12.9 insert the remaining middlewares
around it while preserving Metrics outside the semaphore.

Pure observer: never mutates ``request`` or transforms ``response``. Around
``next_call`` it captures the wall-clock elapsed time of the chain-inner
operation (which includes whatever HTTP/auth/retry behavior the inner
middlewares + transport leaf perform) and emits exactly one terminal record
per logical RPC:

- Increments ``rpc_calls_succeeded`` / ``rpc_calls_failed`` and
  ``rpc_latency_seconds_total`` on the shared :class:`ClientMetrics` snapshot.
- Awaits ``ClientMetrics.emit_rpc_event`` with a backend-agnostic
  :class:`RpcTelemetryEvent` so application-level ``on_rpc_event``
  callbacks fire (Prometheus exporter, OTEL bridge, custom logger, …).

The emit fires only when ``RPC_CONTEXT_RPC_METHOD`` is present in
``request.context``.
Other code paths through the chain (e.g. the chat streaming path in
``_chat_transport.send_authed_post``, which calls
``Session._perform_authed_post`` directly without minting an
``RpcExecutor`` telemetry frame) leave the key absent and skip emission —
preserving the pre-PR-12.4 behavior where chat-side requests did not
appear in the RPC counters or telemetry stream. This invariant is pinned
by ``test_skips_emit_when_rpc_method_absent`` in
``tests/unit/test_metrics_middleware.py``.

Failure mode: on any exception from ``next_call``, record the
failed-attempt metrics and re-raise. ``Exception`` (not
``BaseException``) — cooperative-cancellation signals
(``KeyboardInterrupt``, ``SystemExit``, ``asyncio.CancelledError``) are
caller-initiated unwinds, not RPC failures; they propagate without
incrementing counters or emitting events. Same scope as TracingMiddleware,
same reason.

This PR also lifts the per-RPC telemetry block from the logical RPC wrapper.
The chain now owns that emission, and ``RpcExecutor.rpc_call`` keeps only the
``rpc_calls_started`` counter plus the reqid plumbing — concerns that live
OUTSIDE the chain and are not transport-layer events.

Semantic refinement vs. pre-PR-12.4: decode-time errors (e.g. ``NoData``
raised after a 200-OK transport return) previously incremented
``rpc_calls_failed`` because the old block wrapped raw RPC dispatch,
which includes decode. The chain wraps only the transport leg, so
decode-only failures no longer count as ``rpc_calls_failed``. This is the
intended Tier-13 endpoint shape (:meth:`RpcExecutor.rpc_call` decodes AFTER
the chain returns) and disentangles two failure modes that the old counter
conflated — chain failures = transport failures, decode failures track
separately if anyone wants to add them.

See ``docs/adr/0009-middleware-chain.md`` for the chain contract and
``.sisyphus/plans/tier-12-13-greenfield-migration.md`` row 12.4 for the
PR sequence.
