"""Synthetic HTTP error injection for VCR cassette playback (test-only).

When ``NOTEBOOKLM_VCR_RECORD_ERRORS`` is set to ``429`` / ``5xx`` /
``expired_csrf`` AND
:class:`notebooklm._middleware_error_injection.ErrorInjectionMiddleware`
has been constructed with an injected ``builder`` callable (canonical:
``tests/cassette_patterns.py:build_synthetic_error_response``), the
middleware short-circuits each chain invocation with the synthetic
response so the client's exception-mapping branches (429 →
``RateLimitError``, 5xx → ``ServerError``, 400-CSRF → ``AuthError``) fire
end-to-end.

**The env var is a no-op without an injected builder.** Production code
(``MiddlewareChainBuilder`` in ``_middleware_chain.py``) instantiates
``ErrorInjectionMiddleware()`` with no builder argument, so a leaked
``NOTEBOOKLM_VCR_RECORD_ERRORS`` env var on a user install cannot trigger
any synthetic substitution — the middleware passes through. Tests that
exercise the substitution path construct the middleware directly with an
explicit ``builder=`` argument (issue #1005).

**Production behavior is also unchanged when the env var is unset.** The
middleware delegates straight to ``next_call``; the ``Kernel.post`` chain
terminal runs exactly as it would without the middleware in the chain.

Pre-Tier-12 history (deleted in PR 12.9): this module previously
defined a ``_SyntheticErrorTransport`` httpx transport that wrapped the
``AsyncClient`` BELOW VCR so the substituted response was recorded into
the cassette. Tier-12 PR 12.6 lifted the substitution into
``ErrorInjectionMiddleware`` (chain-level, ABOVE VCR), which closed the
"record synthetic errors into cassettes" workflow — replay-only is the
documented contract going forward; the synthetic-error cassettes in
``tests/cassettes/`` are hand-written from the canonical shapes in
``tests/cassette_patterns.py``. PR 12.9 deleted the legacy transport
class and its direct-instantiation tests.

Public surface kept:

- :func:`_get_error_injection_mode` — env-var → mode normalization.
- :func:`_refuse_synthetic_error_outside_test_context` —
  ``Session.__init__`` calls this so a leaked deploy env raises
  ``RuntimeError`` instead of silently activating the chain
  middleware. The guard fires only when ``PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST`` is
  unset (pytest sets it for every test).
- :data:`ERROR_INJECT_ENV_VAR` — env-var name (canonical string).

    """Return the synthetic-error mode from ``NOTEBOOKLM_VCR_RECORD_ERRORS``.

    Returns ``None`` when the env var is unset, empty, or carries an
    unrecognized value (we deliberately fail open rather than crash a
    cassette-recording run on a typo — the unit tests catch the typo path,
    and the VCR config validates the value separately).

    Returning a non-``None`` mode does NOT by itself activate any synthetic
    substitution: the production ``ErrorInjectionMiddleware`` is
    constructed without a builder (see
    :class:`notebooklm._middleware_error_injection.ErrorInjectionMiddleware`),
    which makes the middleware a pass-through regardless of this mode.
    Tests that exercise the substitution wire a builder explicitly. Issue
    #1005 closes the prior dynamic-load attack surface where a leaked env
    var would trigger an ``importlib`` walk of ``tests/cassette_patterns.py``.

    The valid-mode set is hardcoded here (rather than imported from
    ``tests.cassette_patterns``) so production import time never reaches into
    the test tree. The same set is mirrored in
    ``tests.cassette_patterns.VALID_ERROR_MODES`` and the
    ``synthetic_error`` marker validator in ``tests/conftest.py``; the
    duplication is intentional and bounded — adding a fourth mode requires
    updating all three sites, which the unit tests in ``tests/unit/
    test_vcr_config.py`` will surface immediately.
