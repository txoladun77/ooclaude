"""DrainMiddleware — in-flight transport-operation tracker for the Tier-12 chain.

Per ADR-009 §"Chain ordering" and master plan §2, ``DrainMiddleware`` sits at
the OUTERMOST position of the final Tier-12 chain
``[Drain, Metrics, Semaphore, Retry, AuthRefresh, ErrorInjection, Tracing]``.
PR 12.5 ships it as the first entry of the three-middleware chain
``[Drain, Metrics, Tracing]``; PRs 12.6–12.9 insert the remaining
middlewares inside ``Metrics`` while keeping Drain outermost.

Pure observer of the transport leg with bookkeeping side-effects: brackets
``next_call`` with calls to :meth:`TransportDrainTracker.begin_transport_post`
and :meth:`TransportDrainTracker.finish_transport_post`, propagating the
``log_label`` from ``request.context`` as the tracker label. The chain
caller (``Session._perform_authed_post``) always populates ``log_label``,
so the middleware reads it via ``RPC_CONTEXT_LOG_LABEL`` and falls back
to a synthetic ``"<unknown-chain-call>"`` only for malformed requests.

This PR lifts the drain bookkeeping from the logical RPC wrapper and from
``_chat_transport.send_authed_post`` (the chat-streaming entry).
After PR 12.5, drain admission is owned by the chain — the explicit
bookkeeping calls in those two call sites are gone.

Drain admission semantics preserved:
- ``begin_transport_post`` STILL rejects new top-level work once
  ``TransportDrainTracker._draining`` is set, raising ``RuntimeError``.
  This propagates out of ``next_call`` as it always did — the chain
  doesn't swallow it.
- Nested operations (e.g. an RPC issued from inside a source upload
  whose token was admitted before drain started) STILL pass through
  because ``TransportDrainTracker`` looks at ``asyncio.current_task()``'s
  depth, not the chain seam.
- Source-upload and artifact-polling paths (``_source_upload.py``,
  ``_artifact_polling.py``) keep their explicit ``_begin_transport_post`` /
  ``_finish_transport_post`` calls — they bracket logical operations that
  span multiple chain invocations (the upload spans an authed-POST per
  chunk, the poll spans multiple GET attempts), so the chain seam is the
  wrong scope. Those call sites are unchanged.

Failure mode: if ``next_call`` raises, the ``finally`` clause still calls
``finish_transport_post`` so the in-flight counter never orphans a token —
matching the structure of every previous explicit ``begin/finish`` pair
the codebase had before this PR. Same scope (``Exception``-aware via
``try/finally``, not via narrow ``except``) and same reason.

See ``docs/adr/0009-middleware-chain.md`` for the chain contract,
``src/notebooklm/_transport_drain.py`` for the underlying tracker, and
``.sisyphus/plans/tier-12-13-greenfield-migration.md`` row 12.5 for the
PR sequence.

    Holds a reference to the shared :class:`TransportDrainTracker` owned

    is a write-through into the host's counters. This keeps
    ``drain()``'s view of in-flight work authoritative even when tests

        RPC path, ``"chat.ask"`` from the chat path). A missing key
        surfaces as a defensive sentinel rather than a ``KeyError`` —
        ``__new__``-built fixtures driving the chain raw might omit it,
        and the operation should still admit + count.

        ``await begin_transport_post`` may raise ``RuntimeError`` when
