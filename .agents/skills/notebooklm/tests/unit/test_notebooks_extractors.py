"""Unit tests for named extraction helpers in ``_notebooks.py``.

These cover ``_extract_summary`` and ``_extract_suggested_topics`` — the
named wrappers that replaced raw ``outer[0][0]`` / ``outer[1][0]`` deep
index access in ``NotebooksAPI.get_description``. Each helper gets a
happy-path case plus two drift cases (missing index, wrong type).
