"""Canonical registry of cassette-mutating utilities.

This module is the single source of truth for what counts as sensitive in a
recorded HTTP cassette and for cassette-byte-count surgery. It exports two
complementary halves:

1. **Sanitization registry.** A canonical
   list of regex (pattern, replacement) pairs covering Google session
   cookies, ``__Secure-*`` / ``__Host-*`` cookies, WIZ_global_data token
   fields, email addresses, and Playwright ``storage_state`` cookie objects;
   a single ``scrub_string`` entry point that applies them; and an
   ``is_clean`` validator that judges cookie-value cleanliness via exact-
   match membership in ``SCRUB_PLACEHOLDERS`` (closing a previous
   "starts with S" character-class hole). Before this consolidation the
   same patterns lived as an inline ``SENSITIVE_PATTERNS`` list in
   :mod:`tests.vcr_config` and were duplicated piecemeal in
   ``tests/check_cassettes_clean.sh`` — that drift risk is what motivated
   the consolidation.

2. **Chunked-response byte-count re-derivation.** The
   :func:`recompute_chunk_prefix` helper walks an XSSI-framed batchexecute
   body and rewrites every digit-only ``<count>`` header to match the actual
   byte-length of the immediately-following payload line. After scrubbing
   replaces a 21-char user ID with the 17-char ``SCRUBBED_USER_ID``
   placeholder the advertised count no longer matches the payload, so this
   helper runs as a second pass inside :func:`tests.vcr_config.scrub_response`
   to keep cassettes self-consistent and avoid tripping the decoder's
   byte-count-mismatch DEBUG log during replay.

Why both halves live here, not split into two modules:

- ``vcr_config.py`` is loaded for every VCR-decorated test, but its public
  surface is intentionally narrow (the VCR object + matchers). Scrub-time
  string surgery is a separate concern and benefits from being importable
  on its own (the bulk re-scrub script in ``scripts/`` imports both
  ``scrub_string`` AND ``recompute_chunk_prefix`` directly).
- Decoder tolerance behavior in ``src/notebooklm/rpc/decoder.py`` (still
  parses the JSON on byte-count mismatch, now logging at DEBUG rather
  than WARNING — see #669) is what makes the recompute pass optional for
  correctness; these helpers exist so cassettes stay self-consistent for
  shape-lint and don't add log noise during replay, not to harden the
  decoder against drift in production responses.

- :func:`is_clean`            validator returning ``(ok, leaks)``
- :func:`recompute_chunk_prefix`  XSSI byte-count re-derivation

Upload + Drive token coverage
-----------------------------
The registry below extends the canonical cookie/CSRF/email coverage with
scrubbers for Google's resumable-upload and Drive integration paths:

* ``X-GUploader-UploadID`` response headers leak per-upload session tokens.
* ``upload_id=...`` query parameters echo the same token into request URLs.
* ``AONS...`` strings are Drive ACL/permission tokens emitted with file
  metadata. The 20-char tail threshold avoids matching incidental
  ``AONS`` mentions in code or docs.
* Drive file IDs (33-44 char ``[A-Za-z0-9_-]`` strings) appear inside
  ``"file_id": "..."`` JSON keys and ``/drive/v3/files/<id>`` URLs. The
  pattern is intentionally context-anchored so that bare 36-char UUIDs
  (artifact IDs, source IDs, conversation IDs) are NOT scrubbed — those
  are NotebookLM-internal identifiers and matching them would corrupt
  cassette replay.

Display-name + avatar coverage
------------------------------
The registry below also covers two display/identity leak shapes that the
core structured scrubbers miss because the data is double-encoded inside a
WRB-payload JSON string:

* **Escaped JSON display-name literals.** Google's sharing RPCs emit owner
  metadata as positional list elements inside a stringified WRB payload —
  the display name surfaces as ``\\"First Last\\"`` rather than a
  structured ``"displayName": "..."`` key. The core structured patterns
  key-anchor on the outer JSON key, so they never fire on the inner
  double-encoded form. The display-name pattern anchors on the
  escape-quote shape ``\\"...\\"`` and carries an explicit false-positive
  allowlist (font families, UI titles, artifact/notebook names produced
  by the test corpus) so that legitimate two-Capitalized-word fixture
  content is preserved. This false-positive list is the load-bearing
  safety net — a broad
  ``>[A-Z][a-z]+\\s[A-Z][a-z]+<`` regex without it would corrupt source-
  rename and artifact-list cassettes during replay.
* **lh3.googleusercontent.com avatar URLs.** Both the ``/a/`` and ``/ogw/``
  path forms carry per-user avatar tokens. The pattern collapses the whole
  URL (host + path + token, including any trailing ``=s512``-style sizing
  suffix) to ``SCRUBBED_AVATAR_URL``.

# A "chunk header" line is a line consisting of ONLY ASCII digits — that's the

# avoids accidentally treating a JSON payload line that happens to start with a

# don't need explicit ``\A`` / ``\Z`` (claude-bot review on PR #554).
_CHUNK_HEADER_RE = re.compile(r"\d+")


def recompute_chunk_prefix(body: str) -> str:
    """Re-derive ``<count>`` prefixes in a chunked response body.

    Google's batchexecute responses are framed as alternating header/payload
    lines, optionally preceded by the XSSI ``)]}'\\n\\n`` prefix. After
    scrubbing replaces strings of unequal length (e.g. a 21-char user ID with
    the 17-char ``SCRUBBED_USER_ID`` placeholder), the advertised byte-count no
    longer matches the actual payload length, which causes:

    1. ``test_cassette_shapes.py`` byte-count assertion failures.
    2. ``decoder.py`` to emit ``Chunk at line N declares X bytes but payload is
       Y bytes`` DEBUG logs during replay (the JSON is still parsed — see the
       tolerance block at decoder.py:217-237 — but well-formed cassettes
       shouldn't trip the log at all).

    This helper walks the body, identifies every digit-only "header" line that
    is immediately followed by a non-header line, and replaces the header with
    the correct count for that payload. Byte count uses ``len(payload.encode(
    "utf-8"))`` — matching the ``len(json_str.encode("utf-8"))`` calculation
    the decoder uses (which is what the cassette shape lint validates, even
    though Google's live framing appears to use a different unit; see the
    Note: block on :func:`notebooklm.rpc.decoder.parse_chunked_response`).
    For ASCII-only payloads (the common case for batchexecute JSON), this is
    identical to ``len(payload)``, so the shape-lint character-length
    assertion in ``test_cassette_shapes.py`` still passes.

    Idempotent: running the helper on a body whose counts already match yields
    an identical string (no spurious whitespace changes). Conservative: if the
    body doesn't look like a chunked response (no digit-only header lines), it
    is returned unchanged.

    Args:
        body: The response body as a Python ``str``. May or may not be prefixed
            with the XSSI marker.

    Returns:
        The body with every digit-only header line replaced by the correct
        byte-count for the immediately-following payload line. Trailing
        newlines, the XSSI prefix, and non-header lines are preserved verbatim.

    Examples:
        Single-chunk body where the payload was scrubbed shorter::

            >>> recompute_chunk_prefix("18\\n[[\\"longer_id_123\\"]]")
            '18\\n[["longer_id_123"]]'
            >>> recompute_chunk_prefix("18\\n[[\\"x\\"]]")
            '7\\n[["x"]]'

        XSSI-wrapped multi-chunk body::

            >>> body = ")]}'\\n\\n10\\n[1,2,3]\\n20\\n[[\\"a\\"]]\\n"
            >>> # After scrubbing one payload from "[1,2,3]" to "[1,2]" the
            >>> # leading "10" header becomes stale; recompute_chunk_prefix
            >>> # rewrites it to match the new payload length.
