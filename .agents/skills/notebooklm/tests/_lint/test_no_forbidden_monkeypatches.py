"""Meta-lint enforcing the test-monkeypatch policy from ADR-007.

This test scans every ``.py`` file under ``tests/`` for the three
forbidden patterns documented in
``docs/adr/0007-test-monkeypatch-policy.md`` and fails if any file *not*
on the shrinking allowlist contains a match.

Forbidden patterns
------------------

1. **String-target patches into ``notebooklm.*``** — relies on import
   string resolution; silently no-ops when storage relocates.

   .. code-block:: python

       monkeypatch.setattr("notebooklm.auth.get_storage_path", fake)

2. **Object-attribute patches via the imported ``notebooklm`` module** —
   same failure mode, different syntax.

   .. code-block:: python

       monkeypatch.setattr(notebooklm._core, "asyncio", fake_asyncio)

3. **Direct attribute assignment of ``AsyncMock`` to the RPC/
   transport surface** — mutates an instance instead of injecting at
   construction. Caught with a negative-lookbehind so chained forms like
   ``self._client._target.rpc_call = AsyncMock(...)`` are also reported.

   .. code-block:: python

       target.rpc_call = AsyncMock(return_value=None)

Allowlist
---------

``_ALLOWLIST`` enumerates the files that *currently* contain at least
one of the forbidden patterns at PR-1's HEAD. The list shrinks as
D1 PR-2 (auth-side migration) and D1 PR-3 (CLI-side migration) retire
offenders. Once the list is empty, the per-file gate becomes a global
invariant.

The allowlist is file-level, not site-level (line-number-level), so it
survives rebases and reorderings without spurious churn. See
ADR-007 "Alternatives considered: per-site allowlist entries".

A few path conventions:

- Paths are stored relative to the repository root and use ``/`` as the
  separator on every platform so the test runs deterministically on
  Linux, macOS, and Windows CI.
- The allowlist enforces *exact* membership: a file on the allowlist
  that has had its offenders cleaned up triggers a failure, signaling
  that the entry should be removed (otherwise the lint silently rots).

    # to catch dynamic attribute assignment of ``AsyncMock`` onto a fake
    # or duck-typed collaborator — those targets are bag-of-attributes
    # fakes (``MagicMock``, ``FakeSession``) that happily accept *any*
