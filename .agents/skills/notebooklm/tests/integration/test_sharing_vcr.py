"""VCR tests for SHARE_ARTIFACT.

Records / replays the ``client.notebooks.share()`` call which drives the
``RGP97b`` SHARE_ARTIFACT RPC. ``share()`` is a NOTEBOOK-level toggle
(public on / off) — it does NOT take a recipient email, so there is no
human user identity to worry about leaking. The only sensitive material
that could appear is auth/cookie material, which is handled by the
standard scrubbers configured in ``tests/vcr_config.py``.

Recording:

    export NOTEBOOKLM_GENERATION_NOTEBOOK_ID=<uuid>
    export NOTEBOOKLM_VCR_RECORD=1
    uv run pytest tests/integration/test_sharing_vcr.py -v

Replay (default):

    uv run pytest tests/integration/test_sharing_vcr.py -v

The test is automatically skipped when no cassettes are available
(see ``tests/integration/conftest.py``).
